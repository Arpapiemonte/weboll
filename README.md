## [TL;DR](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/tl;dr)

Start the local services on your workstation with this command (requires make, docker and docker-compose):

    make

the webapp will then be live at: http://localhost:8080.

    - `CONTRIBUTORS.txt`
    - `LICENSE`
    - `README.md`

- **docker** setup is in the following dirs and files:
    - `compose`: contains the "multistage" Dockerfiles used to generate all the images
    - the multi-container Docker applications:
        - `production.yml`: main config, should match what will go in production, pulls pre-build images from the Gitlab CI
        - `local.yml`: for local development, builds all images locally for development
        - `test.yml`: to run tests locally
        - `localtest.yml`: to run tests in the CI

- **back-end** implementation is in the following dirs and files:
    - `config`: configuration files
    - `manage.py`: the main entry point to start, stop and control the apps
    - `requirements`: specify the 3rd party Python libraries used
    - `website`: where the common Python code resides
      - other files and dirs: common classes, DB interface, templates etc.

- **front-end** implementation is in the following dirs and files:
    - `.eslintrc.cjs`: configuration file for the [ESLint JavaScript statical analyzer](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure/configuration-files)
    - `package.json` and `yarn.lock`: specify the 3rd party JavaScript libraries used
    - `public`: static files
    - `src`: mixed JavaScript ES6 / TypeScript source code for the webapp's pages and components
      - other files and dirs: common components, pages, assets etc.
    - `tsconfig*.json`: [TypeScript configuration](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/tsconfig-json.html)
    - `vite.config.js`: configuration file for the [Vite Frontend Tooling](https://vitejs.dev/config/)

- **bulletins folders** each bulletin has its specific folder with this structure:
    - a `w` followed by the identification number of the bulletin gives the name for the folder, in particular
        - `w05`: for Meteo bulletins
        - `w16`: for Ozono bulletins
    - `/back` subfolder containing the backend for the specific bulletin
    - `/front` subfolder containing the frontend for the specific bulletin
    - `/templates` subfolder containing the templates 
    

- **tests** are in:
    - `screenshots`: the reference screenshots for how the UI should look like
    - `tests`: test implementation
      - `tests/unit`: JavaScript unit tests
        - `tests/unit/w05`: for Meteo bulletins
        - `tests/unit/w16`: for Ozono bulletins
    - `.pylintrc`, `pytest.ini` and `setup.cfg`: Python test configuration

## Containerization and Continuous integration

The Gitlab Continuous Integration is used to run a number of tests each time a commit is pushed to any branch, and to build container images that can be used to quickly reproduce things and/or for deployment.

The entire pipeline runs on each branch except tagging the images with `latest`, so when you open an Merge Request (MR) you're pretty sure that you are not breaking things.

The Gitlab CI runs 4 stages:

- **Prepare**: define some variables that control the rest of the pipeline and run the linters for Python etc. in parallel

- **Build images** in three steps, and push the to the GitLab registry with a `test-xyz` tag:
    1. application dependencies for production
    2. intermediate images with build / test dependencies
    3. the applications

- **Test**: run tests in parallel:
    1. unit tests
    2. static type checking with [mypy](http://mypy-lang.org/)
    3. integration tests of the entire architecture using Docker Compose inside a docker container (!), including visual regression testing

- **Tag** (only runs on master branch): If all tests pass, the pipeline tags the images as `latest` (makeing them the current ones used by docker).

From the single "multistage" Dockerfile 4 images are derived:

1. application dependencies for production
2. build / test dependencies
3. the complete images for production
4. the complete image for testing

Images 1 and 2 are separated to make it easier to reuse them, particularly because the ones for building / testing are big and generating them every time would slow down development.

The images so built and tagged can be used locally to make reproducing errors quicker.

The **unit tests** are faster to write and run but **integration tests** allow you to test something as close as possible to production.

In addition, integration tests use Selenium so they can also test the UI and client-side JavaScript.

For visual regression testing Selenium is used to take screenshots and reports an error when it finds a difference with respect to the expected screenshot (but it is easy to update references when making changes).
